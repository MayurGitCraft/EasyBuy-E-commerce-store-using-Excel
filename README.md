# Data Analysis :-
1) For data analysis, I explored trends in sales, customer behavior, and product preferences by examining key metrics such as total sales, purchase frequency, and customer demographics. This analysis helped identify patterns that could drive strategic decisions to boost future sales.

# Data Visualizations:-
Using pivot tables, I created pivot charts to present the data in a more organized and visual format. I also incorporated slicers to easily filter through the data and combined all the charts to build an interactive dashboard.

The dashboard includes charts such as monthly sales trends, top-performing product categories, customer age group analysis, sales performance by region, and total sales by payment method. The dashboard is designed to help the store owner gain actionable insights to improve sales strategies and customer engagement.

Below is a snippet of the final dashboard in Excel.
