# Project Description :-
 The project aims to create a detailed annual sales report for A Infinity Store in 2024, analyzing sales performance and customer trends. This report will help the store owner understand customer preferences and make informed decisions to boost sales and growth in 2025.
In this project, I have created an online shopping analytics dashboard, a powerful tool designed to analyze and visualize shopping data for the year 2024.

# Problem Statement :-
  A Infinity store wants to create an annual sales report for 2024. So that, Infinity store's onwer can Understand their customers and grow more sales in 2025:-

1) compare the sales and orders using single chart 
2) which month got the highest sales and orders 
3) who purchased more man or woman in 2022 
4) what are different order status in 2022 
5) list top 7 states contributing to the sales 
6) relation between age and gender based on number of orders 
7) which channel is contributing to maximum sales 
8) highest selling category? etc

# Data Cleaning :-
 I performed data cleaning to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the shopping data, removing duplicates, correcting errors, and handling missing values to provide reliable insights.

1. Removed the duplicates values from gender M = Men and W = Women.
  
2. Removed the duplicates values from  Qty One = 1 and Two = 2.

# Data Processing :-
1. I created a new column called 'Age Group' to better categorize and analyze the data more efficiently
2) According to the problem statement 'highest sales category,' we need to extract the month from the 'Date(G)' column.

# Data Analysis :-
1) For data analysis, I explored trends in sales, customer behavior, and product preferences by examining key metrics such as total sales, purchase frequency, and customer demographics. This analysis helped identify patterns that could drive strategic decisions to boost future sales.

# Data Visualizations:-
Using pivot tables, I created pivot charts to present the data in a more organized and visual format. I also incorporated slicers to easily filter through the data and combined all the charts to build an interactive dashboard.

The dashboard includes charts such as monthly sales trends, top-performing product categories, customer age group analysis, sales performance by region, and total sales by payment method. The dashboard is designed to help the store owner gain actionable insights to improve sales strategies and customer engagement.

Below is a snippet of the final dashboard in Excel.
